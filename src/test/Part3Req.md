# Part 3:  Write Unit Tests using JUnit 
## Write Unit Tests using JUnit  to represent *at least **three*** of the test cases described in Chapter 1 [^1] of the text.  
*For Example:* 
- Test for valid scalene triangle•
- Test that accepts the sides of a scalene triangle in all possible orders•
- Test that accepts a zero length side

## Chapter 1 [^1] Unit Test Examples



1. Do you have a test case that represents a valid scalene triangle? (Note that test cases such as 1, 2, 3 and 2, 5, 10 do not warrant a yes answer because a triangle having these dimensions is not valid.)

2. Do you have a test case that represents a valid equilateral triangle?

3. Do you have a test case that represents a valid isosceles triangle? (Note that a test case representing 2, 2, 4 would not count because it is not a valid triangle.)

4. Do you have at least three test cases that represent valid isosceles triangles such that you have tried all three permutations of two equal sides (such as, 3, 3, 4; 3, 4, 3; and 4, 3, 3)?

5. Do you have a test case in which one side has a zero value?

6. Do you have a test case in which one side has a negative value?

7. Do you have a test case with three integers greater than zero such that the sum of two of the numbers is equal to the third? (That is, if the program said that 1, 2, 3 represents a scalene triangle, it would contain a bug.)

8. Do you have at least three test cases in category 7 such that you have tried all three permutations where the length of one side is equal to the sum of the lengths of the other two sides (e.g., 1, 2, 3; 1, 3, 2; and 3, 1, 2)?

9. Do you have a test case with three integers greater than zero such that the sum of two of the numbers is less than the third (such as 1, 2, 4 or 12, 15, 30)?

10. Do you have at least three test cases in category 9 such that you have tried all three permutations (e.g., 1, 2, 4; 1, 4, 2; and 4, 1, 2)?

11. Do you have a test case in which all sides are zero (0, 0, 0)?

12. Do you have at least one test case specifying noninteger values (such as 2.5, 3.5, 5.5)?

13. Do you have at least one test case specifying the wrong number of values (two rather than three integers, for example)?

14. For each test case did you specify the expected output from the program in addition to the input values?
